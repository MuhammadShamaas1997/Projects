Every student is unique in a special way, and has the potential to excel in some discipline. However, standardized letter grade system hinders children from reaching their full potential. Children have to attempt subjects from many diverse fields, whereas they should be spending effort on their favorite subject. Until and unless, a physics enthusiast aces subjects like History, Chemistry, Religious Studies and Literature, he is not granted admission into the college of his choice. If a Pass Fail scheme is employed, the students will be able to pass the unnecessary subjects with minimum effort, and focus better on their future career prospects.
Although letter grading is useful in discerning between the best and the rest, it is not justified if a semester’s worth of syllabus is tested in a few hours. Time scheduling pressure can dispirit any student; even the best one. Hence, all the effort for the A is wasted because one mark drops him below the threshold. This imperfection causes psychological problems like stress, anger and regret. The Pass Fail scheme can easily discern whether a student is motivated to learn or not. Therefore, the grading system must be engineered to judge the retention of academic concepts rather than perfection of exam attempt. 
Thresholds generate unnecessary stress for imperfect students, creating friction with teachers and envy towards over achievers. This bias is not conducive to a healthy learning environment. An A grade student is usually revered while a B grade student is frequently admonished. As a result, under-achievers harbor ill will for teachers, and develop a distaste for learning. Although high achievers deserve praise and acknowledgement; parents, teachers and employers do not have the right to scorn a student who barely missed the mark. With a single threshold grading method, this discrimination can be expunged; so that all passing students will get equal career opportunities.
